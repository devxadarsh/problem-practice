Question:
You are working on a movie recommendation system.
Each movie has a title, genre, and rating.
The system recommends movies to users based on their preferences.

You have the following list of movies:

List<Movie> movies = Arrays.asList(
    new Movie("Inception", "Sci-Fi", 8.8),
    new Movie("Titanic", "Romance", 7.8),
    new Movie("The Matrix", "Sci-Fi", 8.7),
    new Movie("The Notebook", "Romance", 7.9),
    new Movie("Interstellar", "Sci-Fi", 8.6)
);

Write a functional programming solution using Streams in Java to:

Filter out movies that are of the "Sci-Fi" genre.
Sort them in descending order of rating.
Collect the top 2 highest-rated "Sci-Fi" movies and print their titles.

Follow-up:
What would happen if the list contained no "Sci-Fi" movies?
How can you handle that gracefully in your solution?
This type of question assesses understanding of functional programming,
particularly filtering, sorting, and handling edge cases in a functional style using Streams in Java.
