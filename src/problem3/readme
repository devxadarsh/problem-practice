Scenario: Bank Account System with Concurrent Deposits and Withdrawals
Problem: You are tasked with simulating a bank account system,
         where multiple users (threads) perform deposits and withdrawals concurrently.

Implement a system where:
1. Multiple threads can perform deposits and withdrawals.
2. Ensure that the account balance never becomes negative.
3. Use synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions.

Requirements:
1. Implement a BankAccount class with methods deposit() and withdraw().
2. Use multiple threads to simulate different users accessing the bank account.
3. Ensure that the balance never goes negative,
   even with multiple threads operating simultaneously.
